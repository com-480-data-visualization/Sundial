### Dataset

Our project focuses on coffee, and we will create four visualizations using the following datasets:

Coffee Bean Production Locations and properties (https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/coffee/): This dataset includes geographic data on coffee bean production locations, as well as scores for various properties such as aroma, aftertaste, acidity, balance, and sweetness. It is sourced from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), an organization dedicated to inspecting coffee quality. Since the data is already clean, no additional processing is needed.

Global Import and Export Data (https://resourcetrade.earth/?year=2017&category=904&units=value&autozoom=1): This dataset provides information on the monetary flow and weight of coffee beans traded globally from 2000 to 2022. It is created by Resource Trade.earth, which utilizes the Chatham House Resource Trade Database (CHRTD) as its original source. The CHRTD data is collected by the United Nations Statistical Division, ensuring the dataset's reliability, so further data processing is unnecessary.

Global Coffee Bean Production (https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/production/commodity/0711100): This dataset covers coffee bean production worldwide from 2015 to 2024. The data is collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, indicating that it is clean and reliable.

Coffee Bean Prices (https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/coffee): This dataset contains information on the price of coffee beans per pound. The data is collected by the official trading organization, so no further data processing is needed.


### Problematic

Motivated by a passion for coffee, We aim to explore its production, trade, and pricing through engaging visualizations. We intend to showcase the geographic diversity of coffee cultivation by visualizing production locations and their associated quality attributes, highlighting how geographic conditions contribute to different flavor profiles. Additionally, we will illustrate global trade patterns using import and export data, demonstrating the interconnectedness of coffee markets and the significance of trade relationships. By analyzing production trends from 2015 to 2024, we will identify fluctuations in supply due to factors like climate change and consumer demand, while tracking price movements will provide insights into how market dynamics influence coffee prices. Motivated by a passion for coffee, we seek to educate coffee enthusiasts, consumers, and students about the complexities of the coffee market, making this information accessible and engaging through clear and informative visualizations.

### Related work


No existing visualizations have effectively illustrated the relationship between the geographic conditions of coffee bean production locations and the sensory properties of coffee, such as aroma, acidity, sweetness, and aftertaste. Our project will create an interactive website that allows users to explore these relationships visually. By mapping production locations and overlaying sensory data, users will gain insights into how specific geographic factors influence the quality and characteristics of coffee.

Resource Trade Earth has effectively visualized the flow of coffee beans using a map and arrows, where the width of the arrows represents the magnitude of trade flows between countries. This provides a clear and informative overview of global coffee trade dynamics, allowing users to grasp the scale and direction of coffee imports and exports. However, we aim to supplement this existing visualization by delving deeper into the relationship between import and export activities and the sensory properties of coffee beans, such as aroma, acidity, sweetness, and aftertaste. By integrating these sensory attributes into our analysis, we can uncover valuable insights into how the quality of coffee influences trade patterns and market preferences.

The USDA has effectively visualized coffee production data using a global map for the years 2024-2025, offering a snapshot of current production levels and geographical distribution. However, we intend to extend this visualization to cover production data from 2015 onward, creating a comprehensive time-series analysis that captures the trends and changes in coffee production over nearly a decade. By including historical data, we can provide valuable insights into the evolution of coffee production globally.

Trading Economics has visualized coffee price trends using standard graphs. In contrast, we plan to enhance this analysis by integrating price data with production and trade data to explore the correlations between prices, production levels, and trade volumes. Our visualization will not only show price trends over time but also allow users to analyze how changes in production and trade impact coffee prices. By providing interactive tools to filter and compare different datasets, we aim to create a more in-depth understanding of the factors influencing coffee prices.
