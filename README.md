## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

Dataset
Our topic is about coffee, and we will create 4 visualizations with these 4 dataset :
1) A dataset about coffee beans’ production locations’ geographic datas, scores of several properties like aroma, aftertaste, acidity, balance and sweetness. The dataset is originated from Coffee Quality Institute(CQI), which is an organization inspecting coffee quality, so the data is clean and no need to be processed.
2) A dataset about the import and export data, like the monetary flow and weight of beans being traded, among the globe, from 2000 to 2022. The dataset is created by resource trade.earth, which uses the Chatham House Resource Trade Database(CHRTD) as the original data source. Meanwhile, the original data source of CHRTD is collected by the United Nations Statistic Division, which indicates the reliability of the dataset, thus further data processing is not required.
3) A dataset about the production of coffee beans among the world, from 2015 to 2024. The data is collected by the U.S. Department of Argriculture, implying that these data are clean.
4) A dataset about the price of coffee bean per Lbs.


### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
