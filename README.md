## Milestone 1 (21st March, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

This is a preliminary milestone to let you set up goals for your final project and assess the feasibility of your ideas.
Please, fill the following sections about your project.

*(max. 2000 characters per section)*

### Dataset

Our project focuses on coffee, and we will create four visualizations using the following datasets:

Coffee Bean Production Locations and properties: This dataset includes geographic data on coffee bean production locations, as well as scores for various properties such as aroma, aftertaste, acidity, balance, and sweetness. It is sourced from the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI), an organization dedicated to inspecting coffee quality. Since the data is already clean, no additional processing is needed.

Global Import and Export Data: This dataset provides information on the monetary flow and weight of coffee beans traded globally from 2000 to 2022. It is created by Resource Trade.earth, which utilizes the Chatham House Resource Trade Database (CHRTD) as its original source. The CHRTD data is collected by the United Nations Statistical Division, ensuring the dataset's reliability, so further data processing is unnecessary.

Global Coffee Bean Production: This dataset covers coffee bean production worldwide from 2015 to 2024. The data is collected by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, indicating that it is clean and reliable.

Coffee Bean Prices: This dataset contains information on the price of coffee beans per pound.


### Problematic

> Frame the general topic of your visualization and the main axis that you want to develop.
> - What am I trying to show with my visualization?
> - Think of an overview for the project, your motivation, and the target audience.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

> Pre-processing of the data set you chose
> - Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work


> - What others have already done with the data?
> - Why is your approach original?
> - What source of inspiration do you take? Visualizations that you found on other websites or magazines (might be unrelated to your data).
> - In case you are using a dataset that you have already explored in another context (ML or ADA course, semester project...), you are required to share the report of that work to outline the differences with the submission for this class.
